#  Dijkstra Shortest-Path Algorithm

## Abstract:

<p align="justify">Right in the middle of Operations Research and Graph Theory, this project consists of implementing <i><b>Dijkstra's</b></i> algorithm to produce shortest-path trees for all nodes of a directed graph. The algorithm is a shortest-path algorithm part of the larger class of Graph and tree search algorithms, with a <b>wide range of applications</b> from graph optimization to network routing protocols, all the way to distributed computing. This project was conducted from February 2019 to June 2019 as a student at the <b>University of Technology of Troyes</b>. Below are a few paragraphs to give you context about the project.</p>

## Business Context:

<p align="justify">One of the very first steps in Data Science and Optimization projects is <i>data preparation</i>. More often than not, data could be stored or modeled as a graph or a tree. In this context, it is essential to prepare and store the data in the right data structures, and this might involve pre-processing the data. For the purpose of finding the shortest-path between all nodes of a directed graph, known as the shortest-path trees, Dijkstra's algorithm is required.</p>

## Problem Description:

<p align="justify">The objective of this project is to implement Dijkstra's algorithm to build and complete a graph based on Euclidean distances, representing the road network of a country. This will therefore make possible the mathematical modeling of many different problems faced while managing a country. Lastly, decision-making will be optimized using common linear programming methods of optimization.</p>
